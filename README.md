Why are we doing this?

to demonstrate our learning and ability to produce a basic full stack app

How I expected the challenge to go.

I expected it to go well as i was confident with what i had learned

What went well?

Very little, i spent around 80% of my time doing the same thing over and over again as the laptop wasn't playing ball

What didn't go as planned?

Example:  Just trying to update this README file has caused the laptop to restart twice.  This is the third attempt, to update a NOTEPAD file, something is broken

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

html- i would like to spend some time on the style / class elements and introduce some more interesting bootstrap items
js - create a method for random playlist generator
